# 🏛️ NextGen Public Service Portal

> **Project Status:** 🚧 In Development
> **Goal:** To streamline public service delivery by eliminating redundancy, enhancing accessibility, and automating document workflows.

## 📖 Project Overview

Public service portals often overwhelm citizens with complex forms, unclear requirements, repeated document uploads, and slow, non-transparent processes. 

This project introduces an **Enhanced Public Service System** designed to simplify workflows, automate document handling, enable smart renewals, and improve accessibility across all user demographics. We are moving from a "Form-First" approach to a "User-First" experience.

## 🛑 The Problem

Citizens currently face significant friction when interacting with government portals:

* **⚠️ Confusion & Rejection:** Unclear document requirements lead to frequent application rejections.
* **📉 Upload Failures:** Systems reject files due to minor format, quality, or orientation issues.
* **🔄 Redundancy:** No centralized vault; users must re-upload the same proofs for every single service.
* **🚫 Accessibility Barriers:** Elderly and differently-abled users struggle with complex UIs and lack of guidance.
* **⏳ opaque Processes:** No visibility on file movement, officer responsibility, or estimated completion time.

## 💡 The Solution: Key Modules

We are implementing a suite of smart features to tackle these pain points head-on.

### 📂 1. Smart Document Management
| Feature | Functionality |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Smart Document Wallet** | A centralized vault that auto-detects doc types, tracks expiry, and prevents redundant uploads. |
| **AI Document Validator** | Automatically fixes rotation, checks blur/quality, verifies signatures, and ensures data matches before upload. |
| **Unified Storage** | Upload once, use everywhere. Categorized storage with expiry tracking. |

### 🧠 2. Intelligent Automation & Workflow
| Feature | Functionality |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Auto-Renewal Engine** | Detects upcoming expirations, pre-fills applications, and enables **one-tap renewals**. |
| **Profile Correction Flow** | Automated verification for name/address changes with suggested proof documents. |
| **Digital Signature Workflow** | Simplified generation and application of digital signatures on official PDFs. |

### 🤝 3. User Experience & Accessibility
| Feature | Functionality |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Guided Accessible Mode** | Step-by-step interface with large buttons, **Voice Assistance (Malayalam/English)**, and a "One-Question-Per-Screen" design. |
| **Smart Scheduling** | Crowd prediction for appointments, smart slot selection, and pre-visit document checklists. |
| **Transparent Tracker** | Visual timeline showing file movement, responsible officers, bottlenecks, and expected completion times. |
| **Smart Notifications** | Alerts for expiry, appointment reminders, and real-time status updates. |
