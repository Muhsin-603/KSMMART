Project Overview

Public service portals often overwhelm citizens with complex forms, unclear requirements, repeated document uploads, and slow, non-transparent processes.
This project introduces an enhanced system that simplifies workflows, automates document handling, enables smart renewals, and improves accessibility across all user groups.


Problem Summary
1) Required Documents Are Confusing

Users struggle to understand what documents they must upload for any service, causing frequent application rejection.

2) Document Upload Errors

Documents fail to upload due to wrong format, low-quality scans, mismatched details, or incorrect orientation.

3) No Unified Document Storage

Citizens repeatedly upload the same documents because the system lacks a centralized vault with categorization and expiry tracking.

4) Accessibility Issues

Elderly, low-literacy, and differently-abled users find the current interface difficult to navigate, with no guided or voice-assisted mode.

5) Complicated Appointment Scheduling

There is no smart slot selection, crowd prediction, or pre-appointment checklist.

6) Limited Application Status Visibility

Users cannot see real-time file movement, responsible officers, or bottlenecks; delays remain unclear.

7) Hard-to-Update Personal Documents

Correcting name, address, or mismatched information requires manual steps and often offline visits.

8) No Expiry or Renewal Notifications

Citizens are not alerted when documents or permits are nearing expiration, leading to penalties.

9) Manual Renewal Process

Renewing permits or documents requires refilling forms, re-uploading files, and repeating verification steps.

10) Digital Signature Complexity

Users find it difficult to generate, apply, and download digital signatures on official documents.
